BEFORE:
- Validation based primarily on assumptions + general best practices.
- Copy and delivery decisions not explicitly tied to extracted objections.

AFTER:
- Validation uses Apify+SerpAPI signals to ground copy, FAQ, and delivery structure.
- Quality gate includes “must-have” sections derived from real objections (download, setup, license).
- Delivery default: ZIP + Start Here + Pages + folders; category-specific import/duplicate guidance.
