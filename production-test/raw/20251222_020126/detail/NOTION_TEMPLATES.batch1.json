Designing the perfect Notion setup takes WEEKS if not MONTHS. With Headquarters you can download and start using a proven productivity formula immediately.<br></p><p><strong>👉 \"I'm already using Notion, why do I need this?\"</strong></p><p>A lot of people who download Headquarters are already using Notion. Most of the time, they started using Notion but haven't found that smooth and seamless productivity setup just yet. With Notion you can build ANYTHING. The problem with that, is that you can build ANYTHING. And most of the time, it's not an optimal setup. I took MONTHS to build Headquarters, and tried every productivity method under the sun, and only implemented the ones that actually work. Headquarters isn't a bloated template with pointless widgets and clutter; it's made with one thing in mind: <strong>true</strong> <strong>productivity</strong>.<br></p><p><strong>👉 \"What if it's too complicated for me?\"</strong></p><p>That's the best part! Unlike other Notion templates, that are packed with random (and pointless) features to pump up the price. I built this around the productivity methods that <em>actually</em> provided me value. And, I created an easy to follow template walkthrough so you know how it all works. My goal was that if you have a basic understanding of Notion, then you'll understand Headquarters.<br></p><h2>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ <strong>5 STARS with 3500+ USERS</strong>\n</h2><p>I get incredible stories every week from Headquarters users, here are some of my favourites...</p><figure><img src=\"https://public-files.gumroad.com/89d51gbmvogv7zi5jhowlm5qaqd7\"><p class=\"figcaption\"></p></figure><figure><img src=\"https://public-files.gumroad.com/czxd521kvgteyzvt3sww691rxudw\"><p class=\"figcaption\"></p></figure><hr><h3>Headquarters FAQ</h3><p><strong>How do I start using it?</strong></p><p>After purchase, you will find the link to duplicate the Headquarters Notion Template into your Notion account.
