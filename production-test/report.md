# GumGenie Production Test Report

Generated at: 2025-12-22T04:09:22.749Z

## Comprehensive Overview
- This report captures Ask → Turbo orchestration outputs for all 4 template categories.
- Includes Apify-based market snapshot signals and a preview of formatted Canvas blocks.

## Strategic Analysis (cross-category)
- Pricing: Use 3-tier pricing with clear upgrade paths + value anchoring.
- Proof strategy by category:
  - AI Prompts: frameworks, benchmarks, multi-model compatibility
  - Notion Templates: setup simplicity, workflow clarity, database sophistication
  - Digital Planners: lifestyle outcomes, aesthetics, app compatibility
  - Design Templates: ROI, time-saved, commercial licensing
- Packaging: include a ZIP if payload > 500MB to ensure reliable “Download all” behavior (per Gumroad guidance).

## Key Insights
1. Use a single, consistent block type per intent (pricing → pricing block; FAQ → FAQ block).
2. Always collect a style preference before final component generation to avoid mismatched visuals.
3. Treat versions/tier delivery as a product architecture, not just pricing.

## Key Actionable Steps
1. Run Turbo for each category with style follow-up: Glassmorphic / Minimalist / 3D.
2. Verify formatted blocks render correctly in the Canvas preview and insert cleanly.
3. Map deliverables into Gumroad Versions: Starter / Pro / Ultimate.
4. Build a full-assembly ZIP with Start Here + License + Support.

## Workflow Execution Log
- This export captures artifacts from the latest local runs (Ask/Turbo JSON + formatted block + market snapshot).
- For per-request timing logs, run the frontend with `?debugChat` and re-export.
